# CPP_Project-Cake-Management-System
The Cake Management System using C++ is a menu-driven programme that stores Cake ID, Cake Name, Quantity of Cake,and Price of the Cake. This programme has two sections. One is the Admin Panel(Login) and the second is the User Panel.  We provided an Admin User Name and Password in the Admin Panel; if they are correct, the Admin can add, delete, or update cake information.  In the User Panel, you have two choices. First, you can see all the cakes' information and prices; second, you can buy any cake by entering its ID; after that  you will get a bill.
